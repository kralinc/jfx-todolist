# jfx-todolist
A to-do list application in java fx.
I created this program in August 2019 as a super simple way of helping me keep track of what I need to do each day. All editing is done in-app, so no text files have to be messed with to use it.

The app has multiple issues, but it has been my single most useful project this far, using it nearly daily to manage my tasks.
